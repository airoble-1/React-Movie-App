1. How React Apps interact with DBs
2. Sending HTTP Requests and Using Responses
3. Error handling & loading state   

How Browser side code connects to database
--> indirect communication is best practice; otherwise db credentials would be exposed in the browser by visitors to website
see link for more details.
--> Back end app on server will commnunicate with DB and client side app will communicate with back end via API urls  
--> API - clearly defined interface or rules to acquire resources or results; in terms of http request there are two API standards RESTful and GraphQL for how a server should expose its data 
--> URLs or entry points = certain data

Sending Requests
--> Axios a thrid party promised based 
--> Fetch API built in to browsers 
--> data is sent back in JSON but needs to be converted to an JS object
